# Logbook — full build history, issues, and design deviations

Change log covering every phase of the build: what was implemented, every issue
reported along the way, how each was fixed, and where the result deviates from
`blueprint.md` / `implementation-guide.md`. Treat `CLAUDE.md`'s "Working notes" /
"Environment" sections as the current operating rules; this file is the history of
how we got there.

Reconstructed from git history (`git log`) plus the live deployment session —
commit messages for the earlier phases were already detailed, so entries 1–4 are a
faithful translation of those, not a reinterpretation.

---

## 1. Phases 1–2 — design foundation and data spine

Built exactly to `implementation-guide.md` Section 10: the five locked slide
templates (`Masthead`, `CarouselCover`, `CarouselBody`, `CarouselClosing`,
`SingleQuote`, `SingleStat`), the three duotone moods, `/api/render` via
`@vercel/og`, the `/preview` grid, and the Pydantic contracts + authored taxonomy
(`topics.yaml`, `approaches.py`, `entry_points.py`, `voice_register.py`).

**No deviations** — this phase is straightforward scaffolding matching the spec.

---

## 2. Phases 3–5 — generation, surfaces, mobile flow (initial build)

Built per Section 10: the tiered LLM/image providers, `angle_engine.py` (sample
sub-concept × approach × entry-point), `generator.py` (draft → critique → refine),
`validator.py`, `memory.py` (file-backed at this point — Supabase wiring was
explicitly deferred, see #9), the daily-picks selector, paste-link/awareness-calendar
sources, and the mobile screens (home → generate → editor → export).

**No deviations at this point** — the two refinements below happened afterward, as
real generated output revealed problems the spec couldn't have anticipated without
seeing it.

---

## 3. Design refinement: carousel body content was landing in the caption, not the slides

**Problem found:** the original `carousel_body` slide shape (`statement_pre` /
`statement_script` /`statement_post` — a single sentence with one emphasized phrase)
never had room for real substance. For approaches that need to actually teach
something (`story`, `educational`, `framework`, `myth_vs_fact`, `common_mistakes`),
the generator was compensating by dumping the real content into the caption as a
paragraph — leaving the slides themselves thin and the caption doing work it was
never meant to do.

**Fix — a sixth slide template, `carousel_body_teaching`:** approaches needing real
teaching room now get **two** `carousel_body_teaching` slides (1–2 full sentences of
actual substance each — heading + body) instead of one `carousel_body` fragment.
Which shape a post gets is decided once, at brief-build time
(`TEACHING_BODY_APPROACHES` in `taxonomy/approaches.py`), so slide count stays
consistent through validation. Added end-to-end on the frontend too: types,
`/api/render` case, `SlideRenderer`, the `/preview` grid.

**Also layered into the generation prompts in the same pass** (`generator.py`):
- A real structural definition per approach (`_APPROACH_DEFINITIONS`) — previously a post could be labeled `framework` without its content actually delivering a framework's shape.
- Kicker discipline: must disambiguate the topic through a natural sentence, never degrade into a taxonomy label (e.g. never "Career — Salary Negotiation").
- Peer-to-peer active voice, everyday concrete specificity, practical actionability, and judgment-based "saveability" (a reusable takeaway, only when the topic genuinely has one to give).
- **Caption discipline**: the caption's job is a hook, optionally one added closing thought — never a restatement of slide content. `critique_post` now checks all of the above, not just voice/tone/length.

**Deviation:** `implementation-guide.md`'s locked Phase 1 design spec names exactly
five slide templates (`CarouselCover`, `CarouselBody`, `CarouselClosing`,
`SingleQuote`, `SingleStat`). `CarouselBodyTeaching` is a sixth, added after the
fact because the original `CarouselBody` shape structurally couldn't hold what
several approaches needed to say. `CarouselBody` itself still exists and is still
used for the approaches that only need a single emphasized statement —
`checklist`, `stat_research`, and `question_reflection`.

---

## 4. Design refinement: hero images were generic and topic-disconnected

**Problem found:** `hero_image_prompt` was built from the full multi-sentence
angle text. Image models can't visually translate an argument, so this produced
generic abstract clichés (stairs, winding paths) with no real connection to the
specific topic.

**Fix — `visual_subject`:** the same cheap-tier LLM call that already produces
`angle`/`mood`/`reason` in `angle_engine.py` now also produces `visual_subject` in
the same response (bundled — no added API cost for the main angle-engine path):
5–15 words naming one concrete, photographable image/object/scene genuinely tied to
the specific topic and angle — never an abstract mood word ("transformation",
"growth") and never a stock-photo trope (a staircase, a winding path).
`hero_image_prompt` is now built from `visual_subject` via a shared
`_hero_image_prompt()` helper, threaded through `propose → accept → generate` so the
real production flow benefits, not just direct calls. Also fixed a string-quoting
bug this surfaced (raw text nested inside manually-added quotes broke on
apostrophes already present in the source text).

Paste-link briefs (`sources/paste_link.py`) don't go through the angle engine at
all, so they got the same fix via a **separate, real added cost**: a new cheap-tier
call that grounds `visual_subject` in the article's title and excerpt instead of
the bare headline.

**Not a locked-spec deviation** — `hero_image_prompt` was always going to need some
grounding strategy; the blueprint didn't specify one, so this is filling a gap
rather than contradicting a decision.

---

## 5. Phase 6 — initial deployment

**What was built, exactly per `implementation-guide.md` Section 10:**
- Backend deployed to Railway (project `wgs-backend`), `uvicorn app.main:app` via `railway.json`.
- Frontend deployed to Vercel (project `wgs`).
- `CORSMiddleware` restricted to `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`, updated to the real Vercel URL and redeployed once the frontend existed (the guide's specified sequencing).
- Supabase schema created: `brand_kit`, `memory`, `image_cache` tables + `heroes` Storage bucket (`backend/app/db/schema.sql`), plus `backend/app/db/supabase.py` (client + queries) and `frontend/lib/supabaseClient.ts`.
- `DEPLOY.md` written documenting the click-path.

**Deviation — domain naming:** the guide didn't anticipate the requested project name (`wgs`) being available as a Vercel project but not as a bare `wgs.vercel.app` subdomain (`.vercel.app` names are global across all Vercel users, independent of per-account project names). Vercel auto-assigned `wgs-two.vercel.app` as the project's default domain; `wgs-studio.vercel.app` was separately registered as a proper project domain to serve as the clean canonical URL. Both domains exist and both matter — see #10.

**Deviation — Vercel deployment protection:** new Vercel projects default to SSO/authentication protection on non-custom domains, which would have blocked the creator from ever loading the app on her phone. Disabled via `vercel project protection disable wgs --sso` — not mentioned in the guide since it predates this Vercel account default.

---

## 6. Railway env vars only partially applied

**Symptom:** after the first backend deploy, only `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` was actually set on Railway — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_*`, and 8 other keys were silently missing, even though the push command reported success for all of them.

**Root cause:** the bulk `railway variable set` loop didn't pass `--service wgs-backend`. Without an explicit service target, the sets appeared to succeed but didn't persist against the real service.

**Fix:** re-ran the push with `--service wgs-backend` on every call, verified all 12 keys were present via `railway variables --kv` before redeploying.

**Not a blueprint deviation** — implementation detail of the CLI, not the architecture.

---

## 7. `/generate` intermittently 500ing with `JSONDecodeError`

**Symptom:** `POST /generate` (the strong-tier, Sonnet-driven path) failed roughly 1 in 3 calls with `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)` in `_parse_post`. The cheap-tier `/generate/propose` (Haiku) never failed.

**Root cause:** `claude-sonnet-5` defaults **extended thinking** on when the `thinking` param is omitted, with an uncontrolled internal token budget. That budget can consume the entire `max_tokens` allotment, leaving zero tokens for the actual JSON response — confirmed directly: one repro run showed `stop_reason: max_tokens`, `content block types: ['thinking']` only, no `text` block at all.

**Fix:** `backend/app/providers/llm.py` now passes `thinking={"type": "disabled"}` on every Anthropic call (both tiers, one shared `complete()` method). Verified via repeated live-API calls: 5/5 direct `draft_post` calls succeeded cleanly post-fix, versus failing before it.

**Not a blueprint deviation** — a real-model-behavior bug, not a design choice. `implementation-guide.md` predates `claude-sonnet-5`'s extended-thinking default.

---

## 8. Login screen + Row Level Security (explicit follow-up request, beyond Phase 6's written scope)

`implementation-guide.md` Section 10's Phase 6 "Build" list only calls for the Supabase schema, storage bucket, and one auth user to exist — it does not call for a login UI or RLS policies. Both were added afterward on direct request:

- `frontend/app/login/page.tsx` + `frontend/components/AuthGate.tsx`: gates every route behind a Supabase Auth session (client-side check + redirect), wired to the one real auth user created directly in the Supabase dashboard.
- RLS enabled on `brand_kit`, `memory`, `image_cache` (`backend/app/db/schema.sql`): full access for the `authenticated` role, none for `anon`. The backend's `service_role` key bypasses RLS entirely, so this only closes off the public `anon` key that ships inside the frontend JS bundle.
- Verified with a throwaway test user (created, exercised, then deleted): anon reads return empty/`401`, authenticated reads/writes succeed.

**Deviation:** this is new functionality, not in the original design docs. Recorded here rather than silently folded into "Phase 6 as originally scoped."

---

## 9. Memory + Brand Kit migrated from local disk to Supabase (explicit follow-up request)

Also beyond Phase 6's literal build list — `engine/memory.py`'s own docstring before this change said outright: *"File-backed for now — no Supabase wiring until Phase 6 — but kept behind a small store class so swapping the backing store later doesn't touch callers."* Phase 6 as literally written only asked for the schema and a typed client to exist, not for the engine to actually use them. This was completed as a follow-up migration:

- `MemoryStore()` (no `path` arg — how every route constructs it) now reads/writes the real Supabase `memory` table.
- `MemoryStore(path=...)` (how every test constructs it) is unchanged — still file-backed, still fully hermetic, zero test changes needed beyond this.
- `taxonomy/wgs_brand_kit.get_brand_kit()` added: reads the `brand_kit` row from Supabase, self-seeding it from the existing `WGS_BRAND_KIT` constant on first call (no separate seed script). Routes swapped the constant for this accessor.
- **Verified against an actual restart, not just a same-process read/write:** seeded one `status="exported"` record directly in Supabase, confirmed the masthead counter reflected it (`MINDSET NO. 02`) via a live `/generate` call, ran a real `railway up` (full container rebuild — Railway's local filesystem is wiped on every redeploy, which is exactly what the old file-backed store couldn't survive), then confirmed the masthead counter was *still* `MINDSET NO. 02` post-restart and the exact seeded row (by ID) was still present.

**Not a blueprint deviation in the architectural sense** — this is precisely what Section 9 of the guide describes as the target state. It's logged here because it happened as an explicit later request, not inside the original Phase 6 pass.

---

## 10. Vercel domain confusion: removing `wgs-two.vercel.app` broke the dashboard

**What happened:** asked whether `wgs-two.vercel.app` (Vercel's auto-assigned default domain, see #5) served any purpose beyond `wgs-studio.vercel.app` (the deliberately registered canonical domain). Nothing in code, CORS config, or docs referenced it, so it was removed via `vercel alias remove`.

**Symptom:** the Vercel dashboard's project Overview then showed no production domain at all, and the Deployments tab stopped highlighting any deployment as "Production" — even though the app itself kept serving fine the whole time through `wgs-studio.vercel.app` (dashboard bookkeeping and actual request routing are two separate systems in Vercel, and they diverged).

**Root cause:** `wgs-two.vercel.app` isn't a discardable duplicate — Vercel bakes one auto-assigned `.vercel.app` domain into a project's metadata as *the* canonical default. `vercel project ls` kept reporting it as the "Latest Production URL" even after deletion (a dead reference, not a live fallback to another domain). Deleting it broke the dashboard's domain/production bookkeeping without breaking actual traffic routing.

**Fix:** restored the alias (`vercel alias set <deployment> wgs-two.vercel.app`); dashboard returned to normal immediately.

**Lesson, not a deviation:** don't remove Vercel's auto-assigned default `.vercel.app` domain even when nothing in the codebase references it directly.

---

## 11. Phone report: "Load failed" on Generate

**Symptom:** tapping Generate on a real topic (carousel format) on a phone produced a generic "Load failed" — the message a mobile browser's `fetch()` throws on a genuine network-level failure (timeout/dropped connection), not a clean HTTP error response.

**Investigation:** measured the full `/generate` pipeline directly against production, isolating each stage:
- Text lane (draft → critique → refine, three serial Sonnet calls): a stable ~29.5s.
- Image lane (GPT Image 2 at `IMAGE_QUALITY=medium`): **39–112 seconds, highly variable**, including one call that didn't finish inside a 2-minute window.

Since the two lanes run in parallel (`asyncio.gather`), total request time is `max(text, image)` — so the image lane, not the text lane, was the dominant and most variable cost, easily explaining a mobile timeout.

**Fix:** switched `IMAGE_QUALITY` from `medium` to `low` after visually confirming the duotoned output is indistinguishable (this was already flagged in `CLAUDE.md` as a planned-but-not-yet-run experiment). Re-measured live: **consistently 20–32 seconds**, no more 100+ second outliers. Also ~8x cheaper per the guide's own cost section.

**Not a blueprint deviation** — this is the experiment `implementation-guide.md`'s cost guardrails section explicitly anticipated ("Start medium; run the duotone A/B early and, if indistinguishable, set low").

---

## 12. "render failed for carousel_cover: 500" on Export

**Symptom:** after fixing #11, generation succeeded but tapping Export failed with `render failed for carousel_cover: 500` from `lib/render-client.ts`.

**Investigation, ruling things out in order:**
1. Hypothesized the ~2.86MB base64-embedded hero image was too large for `@vercel/og` / the Vercel function payload → **ruled out**: a tiny 1×1 placeholder image failed identically.
2. Pulled full Vercel function logs directly (`vercel logs --json`) and found the real error: `Cannot find module '.../next/dist/compiled/@vercel/og/index.node.js'` — a file that Next.js's own internal `og/image-response` module requires dynamically at runtime, and that genuinely exists in `node_modules` locally.
3. Confirmed via `vercel inspect` that the deployed build really was the latest commit — this wasn't a stale-deployment issue.

**Root cause:** Next.js 16's **default Turbopack production build was silently skipping the file-tracing step** needed to bundle that compiled module into the deployed Vercel serverless function. Confirmed by the build output itself: the webpack build explicitly runs a "Collecting build traces ..." step; the Turbopack build never printed it at all.

**Attempted fixes that did NOT work** (kept here so they aren't tried again blind):
- `serverExternalPackages: ["@vercel/og"]` — no effect; the import is routed through Next's own internal proxy for this package, not a normal external-package resolution path.
- `outputFileTracingIncludes` pointed at the symlinked `node_modules/next/...` path — caused a *different*, harder deploy-time failure: `"The framework produced an invalid deployment package... files in symlinked directories"` (pnpm's node_modules layout is symlink-based).
- `outputFileTracingIncludes` pointed at the real, non-symlinked `.pnpm/...` store path — deployed without error this time, but the runtime 500 persisted (and this path is fragile anyway: it's hash-suffixed and changes on dependency updates).

**Actual fix:** `frontend/package.json`'s `build` script changed to `next build --webpack`, forcing the webpack build pipeline instead of Turbopack. Confirmed via direct testing against the live deployment: all slide templates render `200`, including with the real ~2.86MB hero image, and the rendered PNG output was visually verified correct.

**Also added while fixing this:** the render route's `@vercel/og` import is now a dynamic `await import(...)` inside a `try/catch` (was a static top-level import, which meant the original crash happened at module-load time, before any of the route's own error handling could run). Any future render failure now returns a real JSON `{error: ...}` body instead of Next's opaque generic 500 page — purely defensive, doesn't change behavior when rendering succeeds.

**Deviation:** `CLAUDE.md`'s locked decision — *"Rendering: Satori via `@vercel/og`, on the frontend (Next.js route) — no headless browser, ever"* — is unchanged and still true. The deviation is narrower: **the frontend must build with webpack, not Next 16's default Turbopack**, or `/api/render` breaks in production while still working fine locally (`next dev` and local `next start` never surfaced this — it's Vercel-deployment-specific). Documented as a standing rule in `CLAUDE.md`'s Environment section so it isn't silently reverted later.

---

## 13. Confirmed: generate → render → export works end to end on device

**Report:** after #11 and #12 landed, the creator confirmed directly on her phone that a real generate → render → export pass completes correctly — not just synthetic verification from this side (curl calls, local repro scripts).

**Status:** this closes out the "Load failed" (#11) and "render failed: 500" (#12) issues as genuinely resolved in real usage, not just in isolated testing against production. No further action needed on either.

**Still open, not yet stress-tested (carried over from prior sessions, not re-raised as active bugs):**
- `critique_post`/`refine_post` share the same JSON-parsing shape as `draft_post` (#7's fix covers all three via the shared `LLMProvider.complete()` method), but only `draft_post` was directly repro-tested against the live API before/after the `thinking` fix. Worth a dedicated stress test if a similar `JSONDecodeError` ever resurfaces.
- The hero-image cache (`providers/duotone.py`, keyed by `topic_id` + mood palette) is rarely hit in practice because `angle_engine.py` resamples `mood` randomly on every call, changing the cache key almost every time. Not a bug, just a missed efficiency/cost opportunity.

---

## 14. Citation-required taxonomy topics silently rewriting content away from the accepted angle

**Symptom:** user accepted a Myth vs Fact angle about Rosa Parks (topic
`inspiring-women-who-changed-history`, correcting the "tired feet" myth with
her NAACP training), tapped Generate, and the returned post had no
resemblance to the accepted angle — approach label and masthead survived
unchanged, but every piece of substance (slides, caption) had pivoted to an
unrelated scenario (a Slack reply to a manager). Reported for one topic, but
suspected wider given the mechanism found below.

**Investigation:** traced the request end-to-end. Confirmed the frontend
passes the exact accepted angle/approach/mood/visual_subject through to
`/generate` unmodified (`frontend/app/generate/page.tsx`), and confirmed the
backend uses it as-is with no resampling or retry logic anywhere in
`routes/generate.py`, `angle_engine.py`, or `validator.py` — validation
failures are attached to the response as `validation_errors` but never
trigger a second generation. The actual mechanism was in the prompt itself:
`inspiring-women-who-changed-history` has `requires_citation: true`, but
`ContentBrief.sources` is unconditionally `[]` for the normal taxonomy
`/generate` flow (real `Source` objects only ever get attached via the
separate paste-link flow — no mechanism existed to attach curated sources to
a taxonomy topic). `_brief_system_prompt()` (generator.py) built a "must be
traceable to these sources" instruction that resolved to the literal string
"...none" when the source list was empty, and `critique_post()` carried a
second, separate instruction to independently verify traceability to the
same non-existent sources. Live repro with temporary debug logging on
`draft_post`/`critique_post`/`refine_post` output confirmed `critique_post()`
explicitly named citation/traceability as a "critical failure" and the
stated reason to rewrite the post.

A full scan of `topics.yaml` found 11 of 18 current topics (61%) carry
`requires_citation: true` — this is a systemic condition, not unique to the
one reported topic. Also found that `knowledge_hints` (authored per-topic,
and per its own inline comment intended to keep exactly this kind of content
honest — "biographical facts must be sourced — never invented from memory")
is used only by the cheap-tier angle-sampling call in `angle_engine.py` and
never reaches `ContentBrief` or any of the Sonnet-tier prompts — the one
mechanism that could have prevented this was silently dropped after
angle-sampling.

**Root cause:** a structural contradiction for any `requires_citation: true`
taxonomy topic — the prompt demands traceability to a source list that
never gets populated outside the paste-link flow, and no fallback grounding
was ever wired to the writing/critique stage.

**Fix:** `knowledge_hints` added to `ContentBrief` and threaded through from
`brief_builder.py`. `_brief_system_prompt()` and `critique_post()`'s citation
instructions now branch: real source-traceability language only when
`brief.sources` is actually populated (paste-link case, unchanged); a new
knowledge_hints-grounded instruction otherwise — stay within well-established
public knowledge, don't fabricate specific numbers/studies/quotes/dates,
describe patterns qualitatively when unsure of an exact figure. A startup
validation check now fails loudly if any topic has `requires_citation: true`
with empty `knowledge_hints`, so this bug class can't silently recur as the
catalog grows toward 40-60 topics.

**Verified live, before/after:** re-ran the exact Rosa Parks/NAACP Myth vs
Fact scenario end-to-end post-fix. Before the fix, `critique_post` called the
citation gap a "critical failure" and said "the entire premise of the post is
unsupportable as written" — and `refine_post` abandoned the accepted angle
for an unrelated scenario. After the fix, `critique_post` ran a "Fabricated
specifics check" instead, flagged only one soft claim ("chapter secretary for
over a decade" — an unverifiable specific duration) and explicitly called the
gendered content "specific, not generic" and the myth/fact structure
"delivered correctly." `refine_post` kept the Rosa Parks/NAACP content fully
intact and applied exactly that one surgical correction ("for over a decade"
→ "for years before that day"), with no pivot away from the accepted angle
anywhere in the pipeline.

**Considered and explicitly rejected:** hand-curating real pinned sources
(title/URL/excerpt) for all 11 affected topics — real research was actually
done for 10 of them (Pew Research, WHO, ACOG, IWPR/American Time Use Survey,
Fraley's attachment-theory overview, among others) before this direction was
reconsidered. Rejected because it solves a problem the product doesn't
actually have: the citation requirement's real purpose is stopping the model
from fabricating specifics with false confidence, not giving IG readers a
footnote trail nobody will check. Curating real sources per topic would also
not scale cleanly to 40-60 topics without becoming a standing authoring
burden. Also considered and rejected: a human-verify checkpoint gating
export for health/timely content, per blueprint Section 8 — confirmed
unnecessary since the existing preview → swipe-edit → export-to-camera-roll
→ manual-IG-post flow already functions as human review for every post, not
only health ones.

**Not a blueprint deviation** — this is a stricter-to-the-actual-intent
reading of Section 8's "never cite from memory" principle, not a departure
from it. The literal original implementation was producing a contradictory,
non-functional prompt rather than the grounding behavior the principle
actually called for; this fix makes the mechanism do what it was always
meant to do. Worth noting as a scope clarification: "citation" in this
codebase now means model-facing factual grounding, not reader-facing source
attribution — the two were conflated in the original design language.

---

## 15. Follow-up to #14: `validator.py`'s citation check left stale, then deployed and verified live

**Symptom (self-identified while implementing #14, not separately reported):**
`validator.py`'s `_check_citation` still read `if brief.requires_citation and
not brief.sources: return ["requires_citation is True but the brief has no
sources"]` after the #14 fix landed — meaning every knowledge_hints-grounded
taxonomy post (all 11 `requires_citation: true` topics) would now generate
correctly-grounded content but still get a false-positive
`validation_errors` entry on every single call, since `sources` is empty by
design for that path.

**Fix:** `_check_citation` now reuses `generator.py`'s `_citation_mode()`
helper and only flags a problem when the brief is grounded by *neither*
mechanism (`_citation_mode(brief) == "none"`) — the real paste-link-broken
case, or a taxonomy brief that somehow bypassed the startup loader guard
from #14. A knowledge_hints-grounded brief with empty `sources` now passes
cleanly, as intended.

**Note on scope:** considered splitting this into two separately-firing
checks (one for "sources expected but missing," one for "knowledge_hints
expected but missing," per the original ask) but didn't — with no explicit
flow tag on `ContentBrief`, both conditions reduce to the exact same
detectable state (`not sources and not knowledge_hints`); writing them as
two branches would mean one is always dead code. Implemented as one check,
documented to narrate both readings.

Tests added: knowledge_hints-mode passes clean, sources-mode (paste-link)
still passes clean and unchanged, and the real "neither present" case still
flags — with the new message text. 111/111 passing.

**Deployed and verified live in production**, not just locally: pushed to
`main` (`e2a594b`), deployed to Railway (`railway up --service
wgs-backend`), confirmed the app started successfully (implicitly
re-validating the #14 startup-loader guard against the real `topics.yaml`),
then re-ran the exact Rosa Parks/NAACP Myth vs Fact scenario as a live HTTP
call against `wgs-backend-production.up.railway.app` — `200` in 25.3s.
Content stayed fully grounded in the accepted angle end to end (cover,
both teaching-body slides, closing, and caption all correctly built around
the tired-seamstress myth vs. decade-of-NAACP-organizing fact), and
`validation_errors: []` — confirming both the #14 grounding fix and this
`validator.py` alignment work correctly together, in production, not just
against local repro scripts.

**Not a blueprint deviation** — same classification as #14; this is
completing that fix, not a new departure from the design docs.

---

## 16. Follow-up to #14: frontend `ContentBrief` type left out of sync with the backend

**Symptom (self-identified during a read-only frontend audit for the same
class of drift, not separately reported):** the #14 fix added
`knowledge_hints: list[str] = []` to the backend's `ContentBrief` Pydantic
model (`backend/app/models/brief.py`), but only backend files were touched
in that fix — `frontend/lib/api-types.ts`'s `ContentBrief` interface was
never updated to match, leaving it silently out of sync with the real wire
contract.

**Investigated first, before assuming it was a bug:** checked every place
the frontend sends a `ContentBrief` back to the backend
(`regenerateSlide`/`reshuffleImage` in `editor/page.tsx`, `generateFromBrief`
in the paste-link flow) — all of them pass through the exact object the
backend originally returned; the frontend never independently constructs a
`ContentBrief`. `lib/api.ts`'s `request()` helper does a raw `res.json() as
Promise<T>` with no field-stripping transform. Confirmed: no functional
drift bug, since TypeScript interfaces are erased at compile time and
`knowledge_hints` was round-tripping correctly through every
`JSON.stringify` call regardless of what the type declared — a
type-contract gap, not a runtime one. Also checked backend `regenerate_slide()`
(the one other text-generation path the frontend triggers) — it calls the
same shared `_brief_system_prompt()` fixed in #14, no separate citation
logic to have missed.

**Fix:** added `knowledge_hints: string[]` to the `ContentBrief` interface in
`frontend/lib/api-types.ts`, matching the backend model. Type-only change —
confirmed via `pnpm build` (clean compile, zero TypeScript errors) that
nothing in the codebase constructs a `ContentBrief` object literal that
would now be missing a required field; every consumer passes an existing
object through unmodified.

**Not a blueprint deviation** — a type-contract correction, not a behavior
or design change.

---

## 17. Neither Vercel nor Railway auto-deploy on push — confirmed, and #16 manually deployed

**Investigated on request, not a reported bug:** checked whether pushing to
`main` actually triggers a deployment on either platform, since #16 (the
`knowledge_hints` type fix) had been pushed but its deployment status
wasn't obvious.

**Vercel:** `vercel project inspect wgs` shows no "Git Repository" /
"Connected Repository" section at all — a project with GitHub auto-deploy
would list the connected repo and production branch there. `vercel git ls`
isn't even a real command (only `connect`/`disconnect` exist). `vercel ls`
showed the most recent deployment sitting 5 hours stale relative to the
`#16` push, and `vercel inspect` on it carried no git/commit metadata.
Confirmed: every Vercel deployment in this project's history has come from
a manual `vercel --prod` CLI run.

**Railway:** `railway status --json` on the active deployment shows
`"source": null` at the service level (no repo connected) and deployment
metadata of `"cliCaller": "claude_code"`, `"reason": "deploy"` — explicit
CLI-trigger fingerprints, not a webhook. Commit `92860c3` (fix #14) was
pushed at `14:53:08`, squarely inside a ~15-hour gap in the deployment
history (`00:19:38` → `15:13:54`) with zero deploy activity — conclusive
that the push itself triggered nothing. The deployment that eventually
shipped #14+#15 together only happened because of a manual `railway up`
run afterward, coincidentally close in time to both pushes.

**Consequence — a standing operational fact, not a bug:** every fix in
this project needs an explicit manual deploy step (`railway up
--service wgs-backend` for backend changes, `vercel --prod --yes` from
`frontend/` for frontend changes) after pushing. A merged/pushed commit is
not live until that manual step happens — confirmed concretely by #16
sitting un-deployed for the time between its push and this investigation.

**Then deployed #16:** ran `vercel --prod --yes` from `frontend/` on commit
`42a23f2`. Deployment `dpl_5W7JgiNQHL2vUTcXBpZM2Bs4Hw6C` — `READY`,
`target: production`. Verified both canonical domains
(`wgs-studio.vercel.app`, `wgs-two.vercel.app`) serving `200` afterward.

**Not a blueprint deviation** — an infrastructure/tooling characteristic,
not a design decision. Worth keeping in mind as a standing operational
fact for every future fix, though: `CLAUDE.md` may be worth a note on this
if it keeps causing confusion about whether a pushed fix is actually live.

## 18. Attempting to replace manual deploys with GitHub auto-deploy — partial success, Railway build actively failing until root directory is set

**Goal (requested on top of #17's finding):** connect the GitHub repo to
both Vercel and Railway for real auto-deploy-on-push, retiring the manual
`vercel --prod` / `railway up` workflow.

**Vercel — failed, needs one-time browser authorization.** `vercel git
connect` (both with an explicit repo URL and auto-detected from the local
remote) failed immediately: `"Failed to connect sk2cod/WGS to project...
Make sure... you have access to the repository if it's private."` The repo
is confirmed public via the GitHub API, ruling out a repo-visibility cause
— this means the "Vercel" GitHub App has never been installed/authorized on
the `sk2cod` GitHub account. That's an OAuth/App-installation step tied to
a browser session; no CLI path exists to complete it. Connection not made.

**Railway — connected via CLI, but the resulting auto-build immediately
failed.** `railway service source connect --repo sk2cod/WGS --branch main
--service wgs-backend` succeeded cleanly with no OAuth prompt (Railway's
GitHub App access was apparently already sufficient for this public repo).
Connecting a source triggers an immediate build per Railway's own CLI
documentation, and it did — deployment `ecb97538...` **FAILED**:
```
✖ Railpack could not determine how to build the app.
./
├── .claude/  ├── backend/  ├── docs/  ├── frontend/  ├── .gitignore  ├── CLAUDE.md  └── DEPLOY.md
```
Railpack scanned the repo root (this is a monorepo — `backend/` has the
actual FastAPI app) and found nothing it recognized. **No user-facing
impact** — Railway doesn't tear down a working deployment on a failed
build, so the service stayed `Online`, still serving the last successful
manual deploy (`569d412a`).

**Root directory has no CLI path on either platform.** Checked
`vercel project update --help` in full — build/dev/install-command,
output-directory, framework are all settable, Root Directory is not.
Checked `railway service source connect --help` — no such flag. The only
other Railway path found (`railway config` / `.railway/railway.ts`, an IaC
config system) requires installing a separate `railway-ts-sdk` package
first — real added scope beyond what was asked, not pursued. **Both
platforms require the dashboard for this one setting**: Vercel → Settings →
General → Root Directory → `frontend`; Railway → Service → Settings →
Source → Root Directory → `backend`.

**Current state, left intentionally incomplete pending dashboard action:**
Railway's GitHub connection is live and **will fail on every push to
`main`** until Root Directory is set there. Vercel's connection was never
established at all. Explicitly told not to test auto-deploy yet — a test
plan (empty commit + push, then check `vercel ls` / `railway deployment
list` for a real git-sourced deployment) was given for after both dashboard
steps are done, not before.

**Not a blueprint deviation** — infrastructure setup in progress, not a
completed characteristic of the system yet. Revisit this entry once both
platforms are confirmed working, since right now Railway is in a
partially-configured, actively-failing state that a future session
shouldn't mistake for "done."

---

## 19. GitHub auto-deploy — resolved: both platforms confirmed working end to end

**Closes out #18.** Dashboard steps were completed on both platforms
(Vercel: authorized the GitHub App, connected the repo; Railway: Root
Directory already fixed to `backend` in #18's own dashboard pass). Re-ran
verification from scratch rather than trusting the dashboard UI alone.

**Vercel — confirmed fully working.** `vercel project inspect wgs` now
shows Root Directory `frontend` (was `.`, the stale CLI-linking artifact
from #18). Pushed an empty test commit (`cc5d86d`) — a new deployment
appeared within 5 seconds, built successfully in 34s, and — the decisive
evidence this is genuinely git-sourced and not another manual leftover —
the alias list gained `wgs-git-main-sk2codv1.vercel.app`, a pattern Vercel
only ever creates for git-connected projects. Both canonical domains
(`wgs-studio.vercel.app`, `wgs-two.vercel.app`) served `200` after.

**Railway — trigger worked immediately, but surfaced a second, unrelated
build failure**, caught by the same empty-commit test:
```
ERROR: Invalid requirement: 'uv==': Expected end or semicolon (after name and no valid version specifier)
```
Root Directory was already correct this time — a genuinely new problem.
Investigated read-only before touching anything: no `nixpacks.toml`, no
`.python-version`, no `uv` version pin anywhere in the repo, and
`NIXPACKS_UV_VERSION` was never set as a Railway service variable — it has
always been 100% dependent on Nixpacks' own internal auto-detection.
Compared the failed build's logs against the previous successful one
(`b1d66132`, from the dashboard's own root-directory-fix rebuild): **same
Nixpacks version (v1.41.0), byte-identical repo tree** (the failing build
was an empty commit on top of the succeeding one's exact commit) — yet the
generated Dockerfile's `pip install uv==$NIXPACKS_UV_VERSION` line resolved
to a concrete version (`uv==0.4.30`) in one build and to nothing
(`uv==`) in the other, seconds apart. This matches a known Nixpacks
behavior: its Python provider resolves "latest uv" via a live external
lookup (querying `astral-sh/uv`'s GitHub releases) at build-plan time
rather than reading any pin from the repo — a call that can transiently
fail or rate-limit, unrelated to anything in this codebase or to the git
integration itself. The two prior successful manual `railway up` builds
never had this pinned either; they simply got lucky on timing, which is
exactly why it only became visible once auto-deploy started firing builds
more often.

**Fix:** set `NIXPACKS_UV_VERSION=0.4.30` as an explicit Railway service
variable — removes the external network dependency at build time entirely,
making the build deterministic regardless of GitHub API availability.
Setting it triggered an immediate rebuild (`1eccc4a4`, SUCCESS). Re-verified
properly with a fresh empty-commit push (`fe48dbe`) rather than trusting
that one rebuild: triggered `4e0c2922` within ~14 seconds, **SUCCESS**,
confirmed via `commitHash` match that it really was this commit, and via
the build log that `pip install uv==0.4.30` resolved correctly (not empty).
Backend responded `200` after.

**Both platforms now genuinely confirmed auto-deploying on push, verified
independently with real pushes and real build-log inspection, not just
dashboard status text.** The manual `vercel --prod` / `railway up`
workflow is retired for routine fixes — `DEPLOY.md` and `CLAUDE.md` updated
accordingly.

**Not a blueprint deviation** — infrastructure setup, now actually
complete. The `NIXPACKS_UV_VERSION` pin is worth remembering as a standing
fact: if a future `uv` upgrade is wanted, this variable needs updating
manually, since it's now deliberately no longer auto-detected.

**Correction, added after #20:** "retired for routine fixes" above was
premature for Railway specifically — the very next push (documenting this
entry) caused a real outage. Two clean SUCCESS builds in a row was not
enough evidence of determinism. See #20.

---

## 20. Railway auto-deploy caused a real production outage — build succeeded, runtime crashed

**What happened:** the docs-only commit closing out #19 (`b304278` —
ironically, the one claiming both platforms were confirmed reliable) was
pushed and auto-triggered a Railway build. The build succeeded cleanly:
`uv==0.4.30` installed correctly, all 64 packages present including
`uvicorn==0.51.0`. Because the build succeeded, Railway cut over to the new
container — unlike every prior build-time failure in #18/#19, which left
the working deployment running untouched. The new container then
**crashed on start**: `uvicorn: command not found`. Production was down
until manually recovered.

**Root cause not confirmed.** The generated Dockerfile's PATH fix
(`RUN printf '\nPATH=/opt/venv/bin:$PATH' >> /root/.profile`) only affects
login shells; if Railway's start-command execution doesn't source
`/root/.profile`, `uvicorn` would never be found regardless of installing
correctly — but this exact same Dockerfile recipe had produced a *working*
container (`4e0c2922`) only six minutes earlier, from a different commit.
Byte-for-byte comparable build steps, different runtime outcome — the same
*category* of non-determinism as #19's `NIXPACKS_UV_VERSION` issue, but
this time affecting something that isn't pinnable via a simple service
variable. Not investigated further per explicit instruction to hold off on
more test pushes before this is understood — every push right now is a
real deploy attempt against a live production service.

**Recovery, and a second problem discovered along the way:** `railway
redeploy` was ruled out (would only re-run the same crashed image, not
rebuild). Tried `railway up` from `backend/` (the directory manual deploys
had always run from throughout this session) — **that failed differently**:
`Failed to read app source directory`. Root cause: with `Root Directory:
backend` now configured on the service (set in #18 for the git
integration), a manual CLI upload from *inside* `backend/` uploads that
folder as the app root, and Railway then looks for a doubly-nested
`backend/backend/...` that doesn't exist. This is a real, newly-introduced
side effect of connecting the git integration — manual deploys must now
run from the **repo root**, not `backend/`, as long as Root Directory stays
configured. Re-ran `railway up` from the repo root — succeeded, service
restored, confirmed `200` on `/topics`.

**Immediate mitigation:** reverted the "auto-deploy is the reliable primary
workflow, retire manual deploys" framing in `DEPLOY.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
(written in #19, proven wrong within minutes) back to "keep using `railway
up` for the backend" until this is root-caused, while leaving Vercel's
auto-deploy status as reliable (no equivalent failure observed there).
Also documented the repo-root gotcha for manual deploys in both files, since
it's now a standing behavior change, not a one-off.

**Not a blueprint deviation** — infrastructure reliability finding, not a
design decision. **This entry supersedes #19's closing claim.** Anyone
reading #19 alone would believe Railway auto-deploy is safe to rely on; it
is not, as of this entry. Do not re-enable "auto-deploy is primary" framing
for Railway without either root-causing the PATH issue or observing enough
consecutive clean auto-deploys (through real work, not synthetic test
pushes) to justify confidence — the sample size that led to #19's
conclusion (two successes) was not enough.

---

## 21. Two safety fixes applied for #20, not yet deployed

**`build.watchPatterns: ["/backend/**"]`** added to `backend/railway.json` —
scopes Railway's auto-deploy trigger to actual backend changes, so a
docs-only commit (exactly what caused #20) can no longer trigger a backend
rebuild at all. Confirmed via Railway's live `railway.schema.json` (fetched
directly, not assumed) and its own docs that `watchPatterns` are
**repo-root-relative even when Root Directory is set** — a bare
`"backend/**"` without the leading slash, or assuming root-directory
relativity, would have been silently wrong.

**`deploy.healthcheckPath: "/topics"` + `healthcheckTimeout: 60`** also
added — makes Railway verify a new deployment actually responds before
routing production traffic to it, instead of cutting over the instant the
build succeeds. This is the direct fix for #20's actual failure mode (build
succeeded, runtime crashed, traffic still cut over) — a crashing container
should now get caught before it ever goes live, falling back to "keep
serving the last good deployment," matching the safe behavior already seen
on every build-*time* failure.

Both confirmed as valid JSON and against the schema; full test suite still
111/111. **Committed locally only, deliberately not pushed** — pushing is
itself a live deploy trigger against production right now, and verifying
these two fixes are correct before the next one happens is the entire
point.

**Not a blueprint deviation** — infrastructure hardening in direct response
to #20.

---

## 22. #21's health-check gate confirmed working on a real recurrence — no outage this time

**Pushed the three local commits from #21.** The resulting deployment
(`52303bf6`) hit the **exact same `uvicorn: command not found` bug as
#20** — third occurrence now, still not root-caused, still non-deterministic
against an identical-looking build recipe. This time, the outcome was
different:

```
Starting Healthcheck — Path: /topics, Retry window: 1m0s
Attempt #1-4 failed with service unavailable
1/1 replicas never became healthy! Healthcheck failed!
```

Railway marked the deployment `FAILED` and **did not cut over traffic**.
Confirmed directly rather than assumed: `curl` on the production URL
returned `200`, and `railway status` showed `Online · Deploy failed` — the
previous good deployment (`d5b0caf2`) kept serving throughout. Zero
user-facing impact, versus #20's real outage from the identical underlying
bug.

**Status going forward:** the `uvicorn` PATH issue is still unresolved and
will keep failing new backend deploys until root-caused — but it's now
contained rather than dangerous, which was the actual goal of #21. Worth
root-causing when there's appetite for it (leading candidate: the Dockerfile's
PATH fix lives in `/root/.profile`, which only applies to login shells, and
whatever different shell context Railway sometimes uses to run the start
command doesn't source it) — but no longer an active production risk in
the meantime.

**Not a blueprint deviation** — confirms infrastructure hardening already
logged in #21 actually holds under a real failure, not synthetic testing.

---

## 23. Root-caused #20/#22's `uvicorn` crash — and the vendor's own diagnosis was wrong

**Railway's own platform diagnosis** (surfaced independently, not asked for)
proposed: Nixpacks installs `uvicorn` into `/opt/venv`, but only adds it to
`PATH` via `/root/.profile`, which the non-login start shell never sources.
Proposed fix: hardcode `startCommand` to the absolute path
`/opt/venv/bin/uvicorn`.

**Verified against actual build logs before applying anything, per explicit
instruction — and the diagnosis didn't hold up.** Checked all three real
crashes (`8b10817e` from #20, `52303bf6` from #22) against a known-good
build (`d5b0caf2`). Every single crash showed a warning the successful
builds never showed:
```
warning: `VIRTUAL_ENV=/opt/venv` does not match the project environment path `.venv` and will be ignored
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Installed 64 packages in ...ms
```
This means `uv sync` wasn't just failing to expose `/opt/venv` on `PATH` —
in every crash, **it never installed anything into `/opt/venv` at all.** It
detected a mismatch, discarded the pre-activated `/opt/venv`, and installed
all 64 packages (including `uvicorn`) into a separate `/app/.venv` instead.
Hardcoding `startCommand` to `/opt/venv/bin/uvicorn`, as suggested, would
not have fixed any of the three actual crashes observed — it would have
converted `uvicorn: command not found` into
`/opt/venv/bin/uvicorn: No such file or directory` in the identical
failure scenarios, since that path was never populated in any of them.
The real inconsistency sits one level upstream of where the vendor's
diagnosis pointed: whether `uv sync` respects the activated venv at all,
not what happens to `PATH` afterward.

**Fix:** pinned `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/opt/venv` as a Railway service
variable, forcing `uv sync` to always target `/opt/venv` regardless of its
own mismatch heuristic — confirmed via Railway's docs and the project's own
prior build logs (`ARG`/`ENV "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"` already visible in
generated Dockerfiles from a plain service variable) that this is exposed
during the Nixpacks build step, not just at runtime — no `railway.json`
change needed.

**Verified the actual mechanism, not just a green deployment:** the next
build's logs showed the mismatch warning **absent** — straight from
`Successfully installed uv-0.4.30` to `Prepared 1 package` to
`Installed 64 packages`, no separate `.venv` created. Runtime logs showed a
clean `Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080` and a real `200` on the
health check's own `GET /topics`. Confirmed independently: `railway status`
showed the new deployment ID genuinely `Online` (not a health-check
fail-safe fallback to the previous one), and a direct `curl` against the
production URL returned `200`.

**Not root-caused further:** *why* `uv sync`'s mismatch check fires
inconsistently in the first place (a leading theory, not confirmed: the
shared `--mount=type=cache` uv cache persisting project-environment state
across builds) is now moot — forcing the variable removes the ambiguity
regardless of why `uv` was inconsistent about it.

**Not a blueprint deviation** — bug fix, and a correction of a third
party's own diagnosis of its platform, not a design decision. Worth
remembering: don't apply a vendor's proposed fix on their word alone when
the actual evidence (real build logs, in this case) is checkable and cheap
to check — it directly contradicted the suggested fix here.

**Closing-the-loop confirmation:** pushing this very entry (`d2ab3b3`,
docs-only — `CLAUDE.md`/`DEPLOY.md`/this file, nothing under `backend/`)
came back `SKIPPED` on Railway, not a wasted rebuild — `watchPatterns`
from #21 holding correctly alongside this fix, not just at the moment it
was first set. Production `curl` still `200` throughout.

---

## 24. "The quota has been exceeded" on Generate — a client-side sessionStorage bug, not an LLM provider issue

**Symptom:** on mobile (real device, not simulator), tapping Generate after
accepting a proposed angle failed **every single time** with "The quota has
been exceeded." Reported alongside explicit confirmation that both Anthropic
and OpenAI dashboards showed available credits, ruling out the obvious
reading of the message.

**Investigation, read-only first per instruction:** a repo-wide grep found
zero hardcoded "quota" text anywhere in the codebase — the string wasn't
coming from any WGS error-handling path, ruling out a deliberate
rate-limit/billing message from the app itself. Direct backend/provider
calls (Anthropic, OpenAI) couldn't reproduce it. The user then gave a
precise repro: Career category → "Negotiating Your Worth" (a carousel,
therefore a real GPT Image 2 hero image) → accept → Generate → crash.

**Root cause:** `frontend/lib/session-store.ts`'s `saveCurrentPost()` wrote
the entire `/generate` response — including `hero_image_base64`, a
multi-MB base64-encoded string — into `sessionStorage.setItem()` with no
try/catch. Mobile Safari enforces a much smaller per-origin storage quota
than desktop browsers; writing a multi-MB string past it throws a real,
uncaught `QuotaExceededError` DOMException, whose exact WebKit message text
is "The quota has been exceeded." This happens *after* the Anthropic/OpenAI
calls have already succeeded — the error is a pure client-side storage
failure surfacing through the UI's generic error handling, unrelated to any
provider's actual quota or billing state. Desktop browsers' larger quotas
had masked this throughout development.

**Fix:** `hero_image_base64` no longer goes into `sessionStorage` at all —
it's held in an in-memory module-level variable (`cachedHeroImage`) instead.
`saveCurrentPost()` writes the rest of the response (text-only, small) to
`sessionStorage` with the hero field explicitly nulled out; `loadCurrentPost()`
reassembles the full object by splicing the in-memory value back in. The
`sessionStorage.setItem()` call is also now wrapped in try/catch (covers the
remaining edge case of an already-near-full quota, e.g. Safari Private
Browsing's ~0 effective quota) — degrades to in-memory-only rather than
crashing. Tradeoff, accepted: the hero image is lost on a hard page reload
mid-flow (module state doesn't survive that), where before this fix the flow
never completed at all on mobile Safari.

**Verified in a real browser (Playwright), not just a clean build:** ran the
full login → browse → accept angle → Generate → editor → export flow
against a local dev stack (dev server + local backend, to avoid CORS from
hitting production's `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` allowlist). Confirmed: (1) the flow
completes with zero console errors, where it previously crashed at Generate;
(2) the hero image genuinely renders in both the editor and export screens
(visually confirmed via screenshot — an automated `<img src="data:...">` DOM
check returned a false negative, since `SlideRenderer` paints the hero as a
CSS background rather than an `<img>` tag, not a real absence); (3)
`sessionStorage`'s `wgs-current-post` key is now 2687 bytes with
`hero_image_base64: null` explicitly present, confirming the fix is actually
taking effect and not coincidentally not crashing on this particular test
payload.

**Not a blueprint deviation** — `implementation-guide.md`'s "client holds
the brief" round-trip pattern (used elsewhere for
`/generate/regenerate-slide` and `/generate/reshuffle-image`) is unchanged;
this only narrows *where* the hero image specifically lives during that
round-trip, since the original design didn't anticipate mobile Safari's
storage ceiling.

---

## 25. Browse screen rebuilt: category-first (strict `primary_category`) replaces the flat multi-tag list — deliberate deviation from blueprint.md Section 5

**What changed:** `frontend/app/page.tsx`'s "Browse all topics ▼" flat list (every
topic in one scrollable list, single toggle) was replaced with a two-step flow:
a fixed grid of exactly 7 category tiles (`Mindset`, `Career`, `Wellness`,
`Women's Health`, `Relationships`, `Society`, `Inspiring Women` — hardcoded in
`page.tsx`, not derived from `topics.yaml`), and tapping one reveals only the
topics whose `Topic.primary_category` exactly matches that tile. There is no
flat/unfiltered browse view anymore — the category tiles are the only entry
point. Filtering uses `topic.primary_category === selectedCategory` only;
`topic.categories` (the multi-tag list) is not read by this screen at all.
Everything downstream of tapping a topic (`goToGenerate(topic.id)`, the
`/generate` route, `brief_builder.py`, masthead computation) is unchanged —
confirmed via `git diff --stat`, which shows only `frontend/app/page.tsx`
touched.

**Why — deliberate deviation from blueprint.md Section 5:** the blueprint's
original browse design has a topic show up under every one of its `categories`
tags (a multi-tag display — "every benefit of a graph, no graph infra"). After
review, strict `primary_category`-only browsing was chosen instead: the
masthead already counts and labels every post against exactly one category
(`Topic.primary_category`, Section 11/12), so a browse screen that could show
the same topic under multiple tiles would let her find and generate a topic
from a category tile that doesn't match what the resulting post's masthead
will actually say — e.g. finding "Setting Boundaries Without Guilt" under a
`Relationships` tile (it's tagged `["Mindset", "Relationships"]`) but getting a
`WGS — MINDSET NO. n` masthead on the generated post. Strict primary-category
browsing keeps the category she browsed under and the category the post is
labeled with always consistent. `Topic.categories` is kept as-is in the
Pydantic model/YAML (not removed) — only this screen's logic ignores it.

**Verified manually** (not phase-gated — this isn't one of the six original
phases): `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` clean; grepped `primary_category` values
across all 18 current `topics.yaml` entries — distribution is Mindset 3,
Career 3, Wellness 3, Women's Health 3, Relationships 3, Society 2, Inspiring
Women 1 (sums to 18), and every value exactly matches one of the 7 hardcoded
tile labels, so every topic appears under exactly one tile and none are
orphaned.

## 26. `single_image` generation crashing on certain approaches — approach sampled before format is known

**Symptom:** generating a `single_image` post could fail with a hard parse
error (`ValueError: expected 1 slide(s) (['single_stat']), got [...]`) —
the model returned multiple slide-like objects (with off-schema
`template_id`s like `checklist`, `myth_fact`, `tip`, or several
`single_stat` objects labeled `STEP 1`–`STEP 4`) instead of the one slide
`single_image` requires. First surfaced while testing the (separately
in-flight, not yet committed as of this entry) 37-pair taxonomy
replacement, then investigated and confirmed as a pre-existing,
taxonomy-independent bug — reproducible against the old 18-topic taxonomy
just as easily (see the isolated regression check below).

**Investigation:** traced the sampling call chain read-only before
changing anything. `angle_engine.py`'s `sample_cell()`/`generate_angle()`
picks an approach purely from `topic.seed_angles × APPROACHES (all 8) ×
ENTRY_POINTS` — `format` was never a parameter anywhere in that file.
`format` is known to the caller (`routes/generate.py`'s `run_generate()`,
which receives it as a plain argument) at the exact same point
`generate_angle()` gets called, but the plumbing simply never passed it
down; `format` was only used afterward, in `brief_builder.py`, to compute
`slide_count` — by then the approach was already irreversibly sampled.
`generator.py`'s `slide_roles_for()` collapses `single_image` to exactly
one slide role (`single_quote` for the poetic register, `single_stat` for
the direct register) regardless of which approach got sampled.

Deliberately tested all 8 approaches forced onto `single_image` (multiple
live `/generate` trials per approach, not assumed from reading the code):
`checklist`, `myth_vs_fact`, and `framework` reliably crashed — each has a
`_APPROACH_DEFINITIONS` entry (`generator.py`) that explicitly demands
multiple distinct sub-items (an "enumerable set," "distinct labeled
parts," or a separate myth + fact), which cannot compress into
`single_stat`'s one kicker/number/supporting-line. `educational` crashed
intermittently (1 of 4 trials — same multi-step tendency, less reliably
triggered). `common_mistakes`, `stat_research`, `story`, and
`question_reflection` never crashed across 4 trials each — structurally
closer to "one fact/moment + one interpretation," which fits the 1-slide
shape.

**Root cause:** approach gets sampled with no knowledge of format, so
nothing stops the sampler from picking an approach whose own structural
definition is incompatible with `single_image`'s hard 1-slide ceiling.

**Fix — Python-side, deterministic, no LLM prompt or slide template
changes:**
- `taxonomy/approaches.py`: added `SINGLE_IMAGE_SAFE_APPROACHES` — the 4
  approaches confirmed safe by live testing (`common_mistakes`,
  `stat_research`, `story`, `question_reflection`), as a named constant
  next to `APPROACHES`/`TEACHING_BODY_APPROACHES`, not an inline list
  buried in the sampler.
- `angle_engine.py`: `sample_cell()`/`generate_angle()` now take an
  optional `format` parameter; when `format == Format.SINGLE_IMAGE`, the
  candidate pool is built from `SINGLE_IMAGE_SAFE_APPROACHES` only,
  otherwise (including `format=None`) from the full `APPROACHES` list —
  unchanged behavior for carousel and for the one caller that doesn't
  know format yet (`selector.py`'s `build_daily_pick()`, which
  precomputes only a hook + thumbnail before a format is chosen — left
  passing no `format`, so it stays unrestricted, matching current
  behavior).
- `routes/generate.py`: both call sites that already had `format` in
  scope (`propose()` and `run_generate()`) now pass it through to
  `generate_angle()`. `propose()` matters as much as `run_generate()`
  here — it's what actually populates the `preselected` angle a real
  client accepts and later replays into `/generate`, so constraining it
  too means a real client can never end up with an unsafe
  approach+`single_image` pairing via the normal accept flow.

**Verified:**
- Deterministic pool-membership check: none of `checklist`/`myth_vs_fact`/
  `framework`/`educational` appear in any topic's `single_image` candidate
  pool; 500 sampling trials across seeds 0–499 with `format=SINGLE_IMAGE`
  never produced anything outside the 4 safe approaches.
- Forcing the 4 excluded approaches directly via `preselected` (bypassing
  the sampler on purpose, the same method used to find the bug) still
  reproduces the original crash for at least one of them in a single
  trial — confirming the fix constrains the *sampler*, not the
  generation path itself, exactly as scoped.
- 6 real, unforced `/generate` calls across different topics on
  `single_image` with the new pool — 0 crashes, 0 validation errors,
  every sampled approach drawn from the safe set.
- Carousel format re-verified unrestricted: 200 sampling trials still
  reach all 8 approaches; real `/generate` calls forcing `checklist` and
  `framework` onto carousel both completed normally (3–4 slides, only
  unrelated minor validation findings — a forbidden-phrase hit and a
  word-count overage).
- Isolated regression check: stashed the (separately in-flight, not yet
  committed) topics.yaml replacement and ran the full suite against the
  *old* taxonomy with only this fix applied — **111/111 passing**,
  confirming zero regressions from this change on its own (one test
  helper, `test_generate_route.py::_single_image_draft_for_seed`, needed
  a one-line update to pass `format=Format.SINGLE_IMAGE` into its own
  `sample_cell()` call so it predicts the same approach the real
  now-constrained path will sample for a given seed — a direct,
  necessary consequence of this fix, not unrelated drift).

**Not a blueprint deviation.** Consistent with blueprint decision 3 —
"Python owns the brief and its constraints; the LLM generates inside it"
— slide shape was already Python-decided and deterministic
(`slide_roles_for`); this fix makes the *approach selection* upstream of
it respect that same constraint instead of leaving Python and the model
to independently discover the conflict downstream, one crashed request at
a time.

## Summary — deviations from the original design docs

| # | Deviation | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | Sixth slide template, `CarouselBodyTeaching`, added alongside the five locked in Phase 1 | The original `CarouselBody` single-fragment shape structurally couldn't hold real teaching content for `story`/`educational`/`framework`/`myth_vs_fact`/`common_mistakes` approaches — content kept leaking into the caption instead |
| 5 | Two Vercel domains in play (`wgs-two.vercel.app` auto-assigned default + `wgs-studio.vercel.app` canonical) instead of one clean URL | `wgs.vercel.app` was already taken globally; Vercel's auto-assigned fallback can't be removed without breaking dashboard bookkeeping |
| 8 | Login screen + RLS added | Explicit follow-up request, not in Phase 6's written "Build" list |
| 9 | Memory/brand kit actually wired to Supabase (not just schema+client existing) | Explicit follow-up request; Phase 6 as literally written stopped short of this |
| 11 | `IMAGE_QUALITY=low` instead of the doc's starting `medium` | The guide's own planned experiment, now run and confirmed |
| 12 | Frontend builds with `--webpack`, not Next 16's default Turbopack | Turbopack silently drops a file `@vercel/og` needs at runtime on Vercel; webpack doesn't |
| 25 | Browse screen rebuilt as category-first, strict `primary_category` filtering — no more flat multi-tag topic list | Keeps the browse category and the masthead's counted category always consistent; blueprint Section 5's multi-tag display could show the same topic under a category tile that doesn't match its actual masthead label |
